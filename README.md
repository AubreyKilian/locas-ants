# locas-ants
A modern Lua remake of my [Ant colony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5wb4f5n6qQ) simulation from 2003 Delphi 7.

This is not a translation, is a remake from scratch using free engine LÃ¶ve2D with friendly and popular Lua language.

(Btw, I'm learning Git/Github so beware of weird things with this my first Open Source"?" project)
